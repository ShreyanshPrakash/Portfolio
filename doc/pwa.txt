1. The pwa is in a way outside the react.
If u intend to use the notification.push or background sync apis, then u will need to be in the react.



2. Service worker event :

install
activate   // reload page here, u can now listen to push notifications and all, sync apis
ready
fetch

// event.waitUntil( return promise )    // for mainly install event as u will do some work for it to complete
// event.respondWith( return promise ) // for maily fetch event

3. More info on service worker

event.request will have the whole info of the request made.
Hence, if u intend to cache only the static file and not the api responses, u can do so here.

event.request.url //
